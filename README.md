# ZillNo (Zillow Home Hider)
Say "No!" to homes that you wish to hide from your Zillow searches. This will prevent homes that you've looked at and decided you do not like from showing up in your Saved Searches and any future searches.

## Features (TBD)
1. Trigger: Only run on zillow.com (extensible using address or other metadata to further websites)
2. Store: Ability to save metadata for a home (i.e. ZillowID, address, etc) in a persistent state
3. UI:
  - Add an icon to Zillow results to hide a home
  - Hide results from map/results list if present in store
4. Auth: Ability to sign-in using Zillow account to hide homes on other devices too
